                <p class="content-text">
                    Today I added in a To Do List. I plan to make a seperate dedicated page for this, and build a main menu soon. Trust me, its on my To Do List ;).
                    Anyway, this project was yet again aided by ChatGPT, but there was a lot more bugs in it, compared to my dark mode project. 
                    However, I have ironed most of them out, and now I have a functioning To Do List with local storage! You can make tasks as completed and remove them.
                    <br>
                    Here is a couple points of interest:
                </p>
                <ul class="content-text">
                    <li>JSON - Saving JavaScript Array to JSON. [THIS ONE IS EXCITING!!]</li>
                    <li>Local Storage - Saving Task Elements and rendering them post refresh.</li>
                    <li>innerHtml - Appending Child Elements for each object in JSON.</li>
                    <li>Template Literals - Combining this with JSON is insanely powerful.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="content-text">
                    I am especially excited about my new knowledge on JSON objects. 
                    Its starting to click how I can use this to implement dynamic web features. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Forcing myself to add even the tinest details, teaches me so much. 
                    One example was clicking on the task to cross it out. 
                    This required me adding an additional object to my JSON object that would give every new task a unique ID. 
                    The parent label of each task was linked to its children who shared the same uniqe ID.
                    This was needed to fix bugs where only the latest task would be checked of no matter which one was pressed. 
                    The label was needed so that click the task text would also cross it out.

                    Hello, my name is Chase Morley. 
                    This is my first website I have built without the power of Webflow, Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, Google Sites or Wordpress. 
                    Yeap, it's all coded from scratch, by me. 
                    I plan to implement features to this site as my knowledge and experience with web development, well... develops ;).<br>So far i have learn't basic for:

                <ul class="content-text">
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>and JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="content-text">
                    This knowledge has been gained by using online course's such as <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org.</a>
                    <br>Not to mention <a href="chat.openai.com">ChatGPT.</a> This tool has been incredible to take my unknowledgable questions and give me, mostly accurate, advice.
                    I am yet to look into GitHub CoPilot...

                I started off by asking ChatGPT how I would implement a dark mode switch on a basic website. 
                It went above and beyond, coding me up all the files needed to start. 
                However, I needed to change the style and insert the code into already existing code. 
                I believe this teaches critical coding skills, it's one thing to write code, but another to read and implement existing code.
